# git test
- **push :**   _This is when you are trying to push the local repository to git hub using command "git push origin"_
- **pull :**  *This is when you are pulling the remote repository to the local repository using command git pull origin*
- **Commit ;*This is used to save the changes made and when you want to save the changes without passing the file on staging process(git add), we used commit -a -m  so the -a will  skip the file from staging environment to commit stage directly  and m stands for message*
